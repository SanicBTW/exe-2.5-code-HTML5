funky port to html5 of sonic.exe v2.5

current issues:

doesnt recognize shared folder :skull: (tried to fix it)

wastes a bunch of memory (100mb and above) which should be way lower (on playstate approx 200mb) pushing on the current state because im too lazy to continue today lol

loads songs correctly but due to the lag and memory usage makes the song unplayable (i have a 4gb ram chromebook, it loads but struggles to play)

wont get sounds properly and nothing else ig
